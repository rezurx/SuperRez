# Contributing to SuperRez

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SuperRez! This project aims to provide a superior, cost-effective alternative to SuperClaude with local-first architecture.

## 🎯 Project Vision

SuperRez is evolving through three phases:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (✅ Complete) - Session management, local analysis, cost tracking
- **Phase 2**: AI Orchestration (✅ Complete) - Multi-AI integration, smart routing, performance analysis
- **Phase 3**: Multi-AI Team Simulator (🚧 Planned) - Parallel AI collaboration, consensus mechanisms

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- VSCode for development
- TypeScript knowledge

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rezurx/SuperRez.git
cd SuperRez
npm install
npm run compile
```

### Development
```bash
npm run watch  # Compile on changes
code .         # Open in VSCode
F5             # Launch extension development host
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **SessionManager**: Project discovery and context management
- **SecurityScanner**: Local vulnerability detection
- **PerformanceAnalyzer**: Local performance pattern analysis
- **AIOrchestrator**: Multi-AI tool detection and routing
- **CostTracker**: Budget management and cost optimization

### Key Principles
- **Local-First**: 80% functionality without API calls
- **Cost-Aware**: Always show cost estimates and prefer free tools
- **Multi-AI**: Support all major AI tools with intelligent routing
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless integration with existing workflows

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
```

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for VSCode commands
- Performance benchmarks for local analysis
- Cost calculation accuracy tests

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Current targets:
- **Security scan**: <5 seconds for typical project
- **Performance analysis**: <10 seconds for large codebase
- **AI tool detection**: <2 seconds
- **Project discovery**: <1 second

## 🔒 Security

### Reporting Security Issues
- **Email**: security@superrez.dev (if available)
- **GitHub**: Use security advisory feature
- **Responsible Disclosure**: 90-day disclosure timeline

### Security Guidelines
- Never log sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure defaults
- Regular dependency updates

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

### User Experience
- **Cost Transparency**: Always show cost estimates
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Work without AI tools installed
- **Minimal Friction**: 1-click common operations
- **Clear Feedback**: Informative progress and error messages

### Extension Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new AI tools and analysis patterns
- **Performant**: Lazy loading and efficient algorithms
- **Accessible**: Support for all VSCode accessibility features

## 📈 Community

### Communication Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions and ideas
- **Discord**: Real-time community chat (link TBD)
- **Twitter**: Updates and announcements
